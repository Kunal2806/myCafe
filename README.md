This is a platform designed to allow customers to order food directly from their table without having to go to the counter or wait for a server. This kind of service can improve the customer experience by making the ordering process quicker and more efficient.

For this project, I used React.js, Hono.js, and Cloudflare D1 as the database.

React.js:
Client-side, interactive user interface for browsing the menu, placing orders, and tracking order status.
Hono.js:
Backend API to handle HTTP requests and interact with the database.
Cloudflare D1:
SQL database for storing and retrieving menu items, customer orders, and order status.
